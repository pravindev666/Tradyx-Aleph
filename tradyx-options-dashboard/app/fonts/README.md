# Arteks Font Files

Place your Arteks font files in this directory.

## Required Font Files:

- `Arteks-Regular.woff2` (weight: 400)
- `Arteks-Medium.woff2` (weight: 500)
- `Arteks-SemiBold.woff2` (weight: 600)
- `Arteks-Bold.woff2` (weight: 700)

## Alternative Formats:

If you have `.woff`, `.ttf`, or `.otf` files instead, update the paths in `app/layout.tsx` accordingly.

## Where to Get Arteks Font:

1. Download from BeFonts: https://befonts.com/arteks-font-family.html
2. Or purchase from the official font foundry
3. Extract the font files and place them in this directory

## Note:

The application will fall back to system fonts if Arteks files are not found, so the app will still work without the font files.
